Duplicate In Array

Problem Statement:
You are given an array 'ARR' of size 'N' containing each number between 1 and 'N' - 1 at least once. 
There is a single integer value that is present in the array twice. Your task is to find the duplicate integer value present in the array.
For example:
Consider ARR = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4], the duplicate integer value present in the array is 4. Hence, the answer is 4 in this case.

Note:

A duplicate number is always present in the given array.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
2 <= N = 105
1 <= ARR[i] <= N = 1
Where 'T' denotes the number of test cases, 'N' denotes the number of elements in the array, and 'ARR[i]' denotes the 'i-th' element of the array *ARR'.
Time limit: 1 sec

c++ solution

int findDuplicate(vector<int> &arr) 
{
    // Write your code here
    int n=arr.size();
    int a1=0,a2=0;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        a1=a1^arr[i];
    }
    for(int i=1;i<n;i++)
    {
        a2^=i;
    }
    return a1^a2;
	
}
